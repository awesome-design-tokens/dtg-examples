# Design Tokens Generator Examples

## üëÄ About

Current repo contains reproduction of the same web application using several popular frontend solutions.  
The common DNA for those project is Design Tokens, created with the help of [Design Tokens Generator](https://www.design-tokens.dev/).

Some integrations require more effort than others, however in a nutshell the process is similar.  
For detailed guides please refer to the [documentation on the website](https://www.design-tokens.dev/).

> Please note that for demonstration purposes all projects are built with React + Vite. Essentially integrations should not be different for other frameworks, since projects mostly rely on CSS, Typescript and JSX.
